Can there be anything more lovely
Than the beauty of a tree?
Her leaves shimmering in the wind,
Dancing so gracefully.

The strength of her mighty roots
That grows deep into the earth.
She's weathered every stormy gale
For all that she is worth.

Standing tall, resilient
With her branches lifted high,
She refused to bow, to break or bend
But reaches upward to the sky.

The beauty of the strength within
As she held her head up high.
Her strong resilient spirit
Grew wings and learned to fly.
